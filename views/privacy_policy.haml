    %h1 Privacy Policy
    %hr
      %p This Privacy Policy was last revised on December 10, 2011.
      %p
        84codes AB (“84codes AB,” “we,” or “us”) knows that
        you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy
        explains what information of yours will be collected by 84codes AB
        when you use the CloudMQTT Service, how the information will be used,
        and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of
        information. Our basic principles are:
      %ul
        %li We won't spam you or sell your personal information to others.
        %li You control how we send most messages to you.
        %li You control who you share your Applications with.
        %li We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        %li We will only collect, use, and share your information as we describe in this Privacy Policy or as you give us express permission to do. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.
      %h2 Information We Collect
      %p
        %strong> User-Provided Information
        \: You provide us information
        about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register for
        an account with the Service. You also provide us information in the
        Content and Application(s) you post to the Service. If you correspond with
        us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email
        address and our responses. If you sign up for a paid subscription to the
        Service, we will ask you for your credit card information, which we store
        in encrypted form.
      %p
        %strong> Cookies Information
        \: When you visit the Service, we may
        send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of
        alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your
        browser and lets 84codes AB help you log in faster and enhance your
        navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey anonymous
        information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not
        collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on
        your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be
        used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies
        can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session
        cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can
        reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
        is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function
        properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
      %p
        %strong> Log File Information
        \: Log file information is
        automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.
        When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain
        information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.
        These server logs may include information such as your web request,
        Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and
        URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
        other such information.
      %p
        %strong> Clear Gifs Information
        \: When you use the Service, we may
        employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the
        online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable
        information from your CloudMQTT account is collected using these clear
        gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to
        our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information
        is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of
        our marketing, and make CloudMQTT better for our users.
      %h2 How We Use Your Information
      %p
        We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and
        provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
      %p
        By providing 84codes AB your email address, you consent to our
        using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any
        notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may
        use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters,
        changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want
        to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences
        in your "My Account page".
      %p
        Following termination or deactivation of your account, 84codes AB
        may retain your profile information, Content, and Application for a
        commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.
        Furthermore, 84codes AB may retain and continue to use indefinitely
        all Content contained in your communications to other users or posted to
        public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or
        deactivation of your account.
      %p
        If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the
        Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically
        send an email invitation. 84codes AB stores this information to
        send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted,
        and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may
        contact us to request that we remove this information from our database at
        support@cloudpostgres.com.
      %p
        84codes AB may use certain information about you and/or your
        Application internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is
        used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and
        personalizing content.
      %p
        84codes AB reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or
        remove the Content you post on the Service if in our sole opinion such
        Content violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of
        Service, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any
        third party. 84codes AB also reserves the right to remove Conten
        upon the request of any third party.
      %p
        We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
        information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or
        the next time you visit the Service; (b) provide custom, personalized
        content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d)
        monitor aggregate metrics such as activity, traffic, and demographic
        patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or
        engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; and (f) help you
        efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track
        Content and users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider
        with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
      %h2 How We Share Your Information
      %p
        Personally Identifiable Information: 84codes AB will not rent or
        sell your personally identifiable information to others. 84codes AB
        may share your personally identifiable information with third parties
        solely for the purpose of providing the Service to you (for instance, to
        process your credit card transactions). If we do this, such third parties’
        use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store
        personal information in locations outside the direct control of 
        84codes AB (for instance, on servers in the cloud).
      %p
        As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business
        offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of
        the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may
        also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate
        divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
      %p
        If you invite another user to share your Application, we will share the
        Application and associated Content with that user. You can change your
        Application sharing settings at any time in you app resource page. Any
        Content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to public areas of the
        Service becomes available to the public. If you remove information that
        you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and
        archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that
        information.
      %p
        Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, 84codes AB
        will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required
        to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary
        to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our
        affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or
        actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service, take
        precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against
        any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement
        agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to
        exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 
        84codes AB, our users or others.
      %p
        Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally
        identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit
        pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested
        third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain 
        84codes AB services.
      %h2 How We Protect Your Information
      %p
        84codes AB uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
        technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
        personal information and implement your Application sharing settings. We
        cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you
        transmit to 84codes AB or store on the Service, and you do so at
        your own risk.
      %p
        To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
        requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
        access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
        your unique password and account information at all times.
      %h2 Compromise of Personal Information
      %p
        In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a
        breach of security, 84codes AB will promptly notify those persons
        whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the
        notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise
        required by applicable law.
      %h2 Your Choices About Your Information
      %p
        You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
        through the Service, in which case 84codes AB may not be able to
        provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your account
        information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your
        account for the Service on https://www.cloudamqp.com. You can review and
        correct the information about you that 84codes AB keeps on file by
        contacting us directly at support@cloudamqp.com.
      %h2 Children's Privacy
      %p
        Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that
        reason, 84codes AB does not knowingly collect or solicit personal
        information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such
        persons to register as Members. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide
        any personal information to or on 84codes AB. In the event that we
        learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age
        13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe
        that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
        contact us at support@cloudamqp.com.
      %h2 Links to Other Web Sites
      %p
        We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or
        from the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please
        remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another
        website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and
        interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our
        website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read
        over those rules and policies before proceeding.
      %h2 Notification Procedures
      %p
        It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are
        required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes,
        to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through
        conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by 
        84codes AB in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the
        form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may
        opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.
      %h2 Changes to Our Privacy Policy
      %p
        If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those
        changes on the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect,
        how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to
        this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
      %p

        site, or your dealings with this website, please contact us at
        support@cloudamqp.com.
