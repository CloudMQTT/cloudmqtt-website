      %p
        %strong 3.3.
        You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal
        rights of the users of your application. You must provide legally adequate
        privacy notice and protection for those users. If the users provide you with
        user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information,
        you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your
        application and to 84codes AB.

        Fees for Use of the Service
      %p
        %strong 4.1.
        Subject to the Terms, the Service is provided to you
        without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your
        purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional
        resources and services can be found
        %a{:href => "/plans.html"} here
        (or such
        URL as 84codes AB may provide).
      %p
        %strong 4.2.
        For all purchased resources and services, we will
        charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in
        the Fees and Payment Policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest
        at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if
        less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all
        taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys
        fees 84codes AB incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent
        permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed
        within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card
        issuer rights). Charges are solely based on 84codes AB's measurements of
        your use of the Service, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the
        fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of
        84codes AB and only in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in
        these Terms obligates 84codes AB to extend credit to any party. You
        acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment
        information that you provide to 84codes AB may be shared by 84codes AB
        with companies who work on 84codes AB's behalf, such as payment processors
        and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit,
        effecting payment to 84codes AB and servicing your account. 84codes AB
        may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as
        subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its
        legal rights or defend against legal claims. 84codes AB shall not be
        liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.
        84codes AB reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Service
        to you for any late payments.
      %p
        %strong 4.3.
        84codes AB may change its fees and payment policies
        for the Service by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the
        beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes
        to the fees or payment policies will be posted in the Service FAQ or the Fees
        and Payment Policies (or such other URL 84codes AB may provide from time to
        time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon
        termination of the Terms for any reason.
      %p
        %strong 4.4.
        You may not create multiple accounts to simulate
        or act as a single account or otherwise access the Service in a manner
        intended to avoid incurring fees.

        of, or through your use of, the Service are the sole responsibility of the

        84codes AB reserves the right (but shall have no

        any or all Content from the Service. You agree to immediately take down any
        Content that violates the Program Policies, including pursuant to a take
        down request from 84codes AB. In the event that you elect not to comply
        with a request from 84codes AB to take down certain Content, 84codes AB
        reserves the right to directly take down such Content or to disable the
        Application.

        In the event that you become aware of any violation of

        or disable the Application in response to a violation or suspected violation
        of the Program Policies.

        using the Service and for the consequences of your actions (including any
        loss or damage which 84codes AB may suffer) by doing so.

        The Terms, and your relationship with 84codes AB
        under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of Sweden
        without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and 84codes AB
        agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within
        Sweden to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
        Notwithstanding this, you agree that 84codes AB shall still be allowed to
        apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief)
        in any jurisdiction.

        For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or
        other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the
        award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to
        resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The
        party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an
        established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed
        upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the
        following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
        and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party
        initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any
        personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
        agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the
        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
